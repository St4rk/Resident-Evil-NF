# Resident Evil NF
Resident Evil Nightmare Fiction is a homebrew written to Linux/Windows and 3DS, it was made on the Nightmare Fiction Engine. The project is still in development, there are several bugs and they will be fixed during the project development.


There are dependences to build the game, they are:

* 1 -> Simple DirectMedia Layer 2.0
* 2 -> OpenGL 3.x

To run the game you must have a copy of Resident Evil 1 or Resident Evil 2 and copy the files to the gameData folder.
