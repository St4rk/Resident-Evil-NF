# Nightmare Fiction Engine
Nightmare Fiction Engine (NFE) is an experimental engine written by St4rk with purpose to learn more about OpenGL and game programming concepts.
The code is very experimental so you are going to find many wrong and unoptimized codes. But I will fix it with the time.



# Dependences
To build the engine without problem you will need the libraries below:
* OpenGL 2.x 
* SDL and SDL_mix
